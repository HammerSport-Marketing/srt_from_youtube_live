&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody.
Hello!

00:03.166 --> 00:06.194
Everybody, please have a seat.
Welcome to the White House.

00:02.000 --> 00:06.197
And I guessth blue and White 
House today because we're giving

00:01.753 --> 00:07.213
 
it up to the 2016 NCAA champions

00:02.224 --> 00:04.985
 
Villanova wild cats!

00:01.794 --> 00:06.038
[ APPLAUSE ]
You should know that we have 

00:01.034 --> 00:04.388
some big fans here from both 
sides of the aisle in congress.

00:04.653 --> 00:09.023
We also want to acknowledge the 
Villanova president who's here.

00:04.114 --> 00:06.114
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:01.326 --> 00:05.662
Athletic director Mark Jackson 
who camped off his first year 

00:00.658 --> 00:03.190
with a national championship.
Pretty good job.

00:03.740 --> 00:05.740
Pretty good.
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:03.364 --> 00:09.605
Unfortunately perhaps the -- 
most important nova grad here Dr

00:04.601 --> 00:10.279
Dr. Joe Biden could not be here.
She may be teaching but her

00:00.692 --> 00:06.167
husband Joe wanted me to remind 
you that he picked nova to win 

00:01.163 --> 00:03.163
it all.
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:01.087 --> 00:03.428
This is the type of wise council
 

00:03.429 --> 00:06.768
that you're looking from a vice 
president.

00:01.778 --> 00:06.056
Unfortunately I didn't follow 
his council so my bracket was 

00:01.052 --> 00:05.698
busted.
We have the best dressed man in 

00:00.694 --> 00:02.786
college basketball.
[ CHEERING ]

00:01.328 --> 00:04.842
The George Cloony of coaches Jay
 

00:04.843 --> 00:08.648
Wright and today we celebrate a 
remarkable team that worked 

00:03.644 --> 00:07.122
tirelessly to make the coach 
look good in terms of his job 

00:02.118 --> 00:05.846
and not just his wardrobe.
His Taylor could not make it but

00:01.372 --> 00:02.436
 
we have his basketball players 

00:02.437 --> 00:06.884
here.
So coach Wright and this team 

00:01.880 --> 00:06.309
treated us to as memorable a run
 

00:01.305 --> 00:05.111
and as memorable a championship 
game as I can remember.

00:00.155 --> 00:04.462
We'll talk more about that game 
in a second but these wild cats 

00:04.463 --> 00:07.848
were about more than just one 
moment or one shot.

00:02.858 --> 00:06.820
She had unbelievable defense.
They had great clutch shooting.

00:01.816 --> 00:07.540
A senior class that won more 
games than any group in wild cat

00:02.536 --> 00:03.377
 
history.

00:03.378 --> 00:07.282
They had a stable of talent 
players who are as happy

00:02.284 --> 00:03.516
 on the 
deck as they were cutting down 

00:03.517 --> 00:07.525
the nets.
He became just the 7th player 

00:02.521 --> 00:06.921
in program history to score 1,
1,000 points and grab 900 boards

00:01.951 --> 00:03.510
boards.
Pretty good.

00:03.511 --> 00:05.511
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:04.590 --> 00:06.274
Also not afraid to do the little
 

00:01.270 --> 00:05.075
thing.
We grabbed the mop in the middle

00:00.071 --> 00:01.414
 
of the game.

00:01.415 --> 00:04.572
We have josh Hart who led in 
scoreing.

00:04.993 --> 00:08.597
Congratulations.
Where did you go to school?

00:00.069 --> 00:02.069
Bidwell friends school.
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:03.646 --> 00:07.561
My daughter will be graduateing 
from there next week which makes

00:03.011 --> 00:04.835
 
me cry when I talk about it so 

00:04.836 --> 00:11.480
I'm not going to talk about it 
but it's good to see you do well

00:01.471 --> 00:03.237
well.
Chris Jenkens aka big smooth.

00:03.238 --> 00:05.238
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:02.683 --> 00:06.118
Learned how to shoot from his 
mom.

00:01.160 --> 00:05.027
Moms know what they are talking 
about and then there is Ryan.

00:00.056 --> 00:06.437
Now I just sped through that in 
case I didn't say it right.

00:01.419 --> 00:03.633
Barack Obama is tough but -- man
 

00:03.634 --> 00:05.854
that is a lot of vowels in there
there.

00:01.270 --> 00:09.561
So we're going to call it -- 
wore the blue and white in more 

00:04.557 --> 00:06.849
games than any wild cat ever and
 

00:01.845 --> 00:05.214
went out in style as the most 
outstanding player of the final 

00:00.210 --> 00:03.923
four so we're very, very proud 
of hip.

00:03.938 --> 00:07.869
Give him a round of applause.
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:04.134 --> 00:08.317
But more than any individual 
honor this team possessed 

00:03.313 --> 00:05.547
something that the coaches 
preached from day one and that 

00:00.543 --> 00:03.570
is attitude.
As coach Wright said in life you

00:03.850 --> 00:05.082
 
cannot control what happens to 

00:00.078 --> 00:04.507
you but you do control how you 
respond to it and this is how 

00:04.508 --> 00:06.864
they bounceed back from dis
disappointing tournaments.

00:02.920 --> 00:07.443
That is how they rolled through 
the first three rounds by an 

00:02.439 --> 00:07.492
average of 24 points.
Beat Kansas to punch their 

00:02.521 --> 00:06.968
ticket to the final four.
They blew the doors off Oklahoma

00:01.964 --> 00:03.964
 
by

00:01.783 --> 00:05.076
 44 point margin which set up 
the unbelievable showdown with 

00:00.072 --> 00:02.567
the Tarheels.
Might be the best title game of 

00:02.568 --> 00:04.955
all-time.
Just last few seconds could be a

00:00.090 --> 00:02.090
 
documentary.

00:02.103 --> 00:08.482
You had an unbelievable double 
clutch circus shot from Marcus 

00:03.478 --> 00:05.273
Paige.
A lot of teams would have had 

00:00.302 --> 00:04.108
their spirit broken.
Wild cats, they took control and

00:04.249 --> 00:06.463
 
they responded and on a play 

00:01.459 --> 00:06.267
called nova Chris took the pass 
from marks and pulled up a few 

00:01.263 --> 00:04.258
steps and shot this team into 
basketball lore.

00:04.634 --> 00:10.858
This was a good shot.
And it was like a Christian 

00:00.849 --> 00:03.781
Lleyton shot.
A Jimmy v running up and down 

00:03.782 --> 00:07.387
the court shot.
Charles Barkley apparently 

00:02.383 --> 00:05.787
jumped out of his seat which he 
doesn't do very often these days

00:00.927 --> 00:02.927
days.

00:04.542 --> 00:10.551
It's -- legendary coach -- who 
led the wild cats their first 

00:00.542 --> 00:05.897
title 31 years ago obviously 
could not be prouder.

00:00.907 --> 00:02.907
Coach Wright on the other hand 
played it cool.

00:04.012 --> 00:06.336
Just turned around and shook 
hands.

00:01.360 --> 00:08.474
Like nothing happened.
So, but I know inside he was 

00:03.470 --> 00:07.869
pretty excited.
So this is a team for the ages 

00:02.865 --> 00:09.338
on and off the court.
They ranked in the top 10% 

00:04.334 --> 00:07.159
nationally with the grades.
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:00.122 --> 00:05.879
Seniors graduated -- since the 
1970s the wild cats have 

00:00.875 --> 00:02.528
graduated every four year player
 

00:02.529 --> 00:05.025
and that is the kind of record 
that you really want.

00:00.035 --> 00:02.035
They are also involved in the 
Philadelphia community.

00:02.937 --> 00:04.855
Serveing meals for those in need
.

00:04.856 --> 00:10.799
Supporting the special olympics.
Arch and the chef heard about

00:01.600 --> 00:04.910
fan a small boy battleing cancer
 

00:04.911 --> 00:09.453
who could use a boost and they 
snuck into the boy's basement 

00:04.449 --> 00:07.724
and hid in his play house to 
surprise him which seems a 

00:02.753 --> 00:08.041
little scary.
But their hearts were in the 

00:03.037 --> 00:05.037
right place.

00:00.000 --> 00:02.105
And that is what we saw all year
 

00:02.106 --> 00:06.224
from this team.
The heart of a champion.

00:01.235 --> 00:03.075
Congratulations to the wild cats
 

00:03.076 --> 00:06.358
for an unbelievable season and 
with that let me give the podium

00:01.914 --> 00:03.194
 
to coach Wright.

00:02.863 --> 00:05.218
this.
